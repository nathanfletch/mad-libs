      Today I went to my favorite Taco Stand called the @Model.Adjective  @Model.Animal. Unlike most food stands, they cook and prepare the food in a @Model.Ride while you @Model.Verb. The best thing on the menu is the @Model.Color  @Model.Noun. Instead of ground beef they fill the taco with @Model.Food2, cheese, and top it off with a salsa made from @Model.Food1. If that doesn't make your mouth water, then it's just like @Model.Person always says: YOLO!

      Story2! Youre a @Model.Adjective @Model.Animal!
